<p>I’d like to talk about a cyclist, Mark Cavendish, born in 1985 on the
Isle of Man in the UK, known as the "Manx Missile" for his incredible
sprinting speed. He joined professional cycling in 2005 and quickly
dominated the sprint stages of the Tour de France, winning multiple
stages and silencing the critics. However, an accident near the finish
and the EB virus significantly affected his career. In 2020, he thought
his career was over in an interview after a competiton.</p>
<p>In 2021, thanks to Specialized, a bike manufacturer as well as the
sponsor, he rejoined the Quick-Step team. In the fourth stage, he won a
Tour de France stage beyond expection for the first time in five years,
equaling Eddy Merckx's record of 34 stage wins.</p>
<p>This year in July, in the fifth stage, 39-year-old Cavendish achieved
his 35th career stage victory, surpassing Merckx's world record, making
him the rider with the most stage victories in Tour de France
history.</p>
<p>From sprint king to overcoming frustrations and making history,
Cavendish embodies the relentless pursuit of victory and dedication to
speed.</p>
<h3 id="看过但想参加的运动">看过但想参加的运动</h3>
<p>I’d like to talk about a sport I watched and would like to try, which
is cycling, particularly inspired by Mark Cavendish. I watched Tour de
France just before this summer vacation, in my dormitory, on the
video-shar</p>
<p>ing website Bilibili.</p>
<p>I decided to watch it because my roommate recommended it. He is a
cycling enthusiast and often talks about various cyclists and their
achievements. He was particularly excited about Mark Cavendish and his
incredible comeback in the Tour de France, which made me curious to see
what exactly attracts him so much.</p>
<p>So I watched it with my roommate, who provided lots of interesting
insights and background information about the race and the cyclists. His
enthusiasm was quite contagious and made the experience even more
enjoyable.</p>
<p>As for whether I will do it in the future, I think I would like to
give it a try. Watching the race and seeing the determination and skill
of the cyclists, especially Mark Cavendish, was very inspiring. It seems
like a great way to stay fit and enjoy the outdoors.</p>
<p>Overall, I felt very excited and motivated after watching the race.
From sprint king to overcoming frustrations and making history,
Cavendish embodies the relentless pursuit of victory and dedication to
speed, which are qualities I admire and would like to embody in my own
life.</p>
<h3 id="想学的技能">想学的技能</h3>
<p>I‘d like to talk about something I would like to learn in the future,
which is bicycle repair. Learning how to fix a bike would be incredibly
useful for me.</p>
<p>I want to learn bike repair because, in high school, I used to ride
my bike to school. The route I took passed by a construction site, and
the small road next to it was always covered with gravel and broken
glass. I had flat tires at least ten times because of this. Every time,
I had to go to a repair shop, which sometimes made me late for school.
Learning to fix my bike would save time and money, and it would be very
convenient.</p>
<p>I’d probably start learning online, where there are plenty of
detailed videos and step-by-step guides. Then, I’d practice what I learn
in our dorm room, with my roommate giving me tips and advice. He’s a
cycling enthusiast and knows a lot about bike maintenance. His hands-on
experience would be really valuable.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s very difficult to learn. It might take some
practice to get the hang of it, but with good online resources and help
from my roommate, I’m confident I can learn it. Plus, I enjoy working
with my hands and solving problems, so it should be a fun and rewarding
skill to acquire.</p>
<h3 id="音乐爱好者">音乐爱好者</h3>
<p>I’d like to talk about my roommate, who thinks music is very
important and truly enjoys it. We've been living together for three
years now. I first met him when I started university, and he walked into
our dorm carrying an electric guitar. Almost every day after classes, he
practices his guitar in our dorm room. For us, it seems hard and tired,
but for him, it seems to be a form of enjoyment and relaxation.</p>
<p>He plays various mainstream genres of music, but he is especially
keen on jazz and rock. His passion for these genres is evident in the
way he plays, with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. He believes music is
important because it provides a way to express emotions, relieve stress,
and connect with others. Music, for him, is a universal language that
transcends barriers and brings people together.</p>
<p>I feel quite inspired by him. His dedication to music and his
relentless practice have shown me the importance of having a passion and
pursuing it diligently. It’s impressive to see someone so committed to
their craft, and it has motivated me to find something I’m equally
passionate about. Overall, living with him has been a positive
experience, and I've developed a deeper appreciation for music thanks to
him.</p>
<h3 id="爱豆的电影角色">爱豆的电影角色</h3>
<p>I’d like to talk about a film character played by an actor I admire,
Rowan Atkinson. I have been a fan of Mr. Bean since I was young. I don't
remember the exact date I first saw his work, but I used to watch "Mr.
Bean" almost every week.</p>
<p>In the movie, Bean The Ultimate Disaster, who he played is an
ordinary security guard at the National Gallery in London. By a mistake,
he gets the chance to travel to Los Angeles on a work assignment. He's
expected to act as an art history expert from Britain and give a speech
at the unveiling of a famous painting. The curator of the museum in LA
invites Mr. Bean to stay at his home, but Mr. Bean’s ridiculous behavior
and odd way of thinking nearly tear the curator’s family apart.</p>
<p>Things get even worse when Mr. Bean accidentally ruins the painting,
putting the curator’s career and reputation at risk. Fortunatelly, Mr.
Bean manages to replace the damaged painting with a printed
reproduction, saving the day. He not only escapes the disaster but also
helps the curator’s family reconcile, forming a deep friendship with the
museum curator in the end.</p>
<p>I admire Rowan Atkinson because, despite his outstanding performance,
he is incredibly intelligent. He studied at Oxford University and earned
a Master`s degree in Electrical Engineering. Yet, he chose to perform as
a clown, dedicating relentless effort to refine his role. The more
people love Mr. Bean, the more it shows his hard work.</p>
<p>Another key point making him admirable is his generosity. Rowan
Atkinson is one of the highest donors to public welfare in the world,
having donated over 300 million dollars, most of which went to Africa.
This shows how much love is in his heart.</p>

<p>Sure, I'd love to share about my first day on campus. It was on the
first day of university when I met some friends I had previously
connected with online. We decided to have a special dinner at a unique
location—the Shimao Quarry Hotel, in Songjiang District of Shanghai.
This place is extraordinary because it's located 80 meters below ground
level, surrounded by massive aquarium-like glass walls with fish and
other marine life swimming all around.</p>
<p>During this dinner, I was really happy to meet my new friend, who
stood out with his medium height, slightly chubby build, and constant
smile. We attend the same university, but we do different subject, he
majors in Digital Media Arts while I am studying Computer Science.
Despite that, we were surprised discovering we had almost identical
interests, from painting to playing the guitar, and swimming. We chatted
for a long time and added each other's wechat and qq, two mainstream
social media applications in china like ins or facebook.</p>
<p>Kevin is a great companion and collaborator. Last June, when I wanted
to join a game design competition but lack of help, he offered to join
my team. I handled the coding with a few teammates, while he and others
took charge of the art design, including characters, scenes and other UI
elements. Fortunately, Our simple adventure game won first prize,
bringing us closer. Whenever we had different opinions, we always
discussed and communicated effectively without any conflicts.</p>
<p>Since then, whenever there is a relevant competition, he is the first
person up to my mind. From the mathematical modeling contest to
application/website design competitions, we’ve always worked well
together, producing exellent projects and winning awards. His outgoing
personality and excellent communication skills, balanced with my
cautious approach, make us a great team.</p>
<p>However, he is keen on buying goods with low price and has a technic
of finding bargains. Most of his daily items, from clothes, toothbrushes
to electronic equipments, are all bought online at the lowest prices
after extensive comparison. Whenever we pass a one-dollar store or a
high-discount shop, he can't help going in and isn't able to control
himeself to buy something at a low price. Though the items he buys are
cheap, their quality and appearance are not bad. He explained that he
prefers not to spend too much on brand value or fashion looks, focusing
instead on the product's functions and cost performance. Of course, he
made exceptions on Valentine's Day just few days ago when his girlfriend
desired luxury gifts. necklace with little diamond</p>
<p>Last summer, we decided to travel together. After researching various
cities, we chose Weihai, a coastal city in Shandong. Despite Shanghai
being coastal too, its nearby seas which are always filled with soil are
yellow due to the sediment carried by the Yangtze River. We had always
wanted to see a truly blue sea.</p>
<p>We arrived by train at night and had a quick dinner at a snack bar
before heading to our hotel. The next morning, I wore a light blue
shirt, one of the most expensive clothes I own, which is a valuable
birthday gift from my mother. I wanted to wear my best outfit for my
first time seeing the sea, and this shirt, though is touched thick, felt
silky and breathable, matching perfectly with the sea and sky that
day.</p>
<p>We took a double-decker sightseeing bus along the coastal road,
enjoying the fantastic views of cliffs, endless sea, and crashing waves.
The 30 km route connected multiple beaches, coastal parks, islands, and
old buildings. The ride was smooth, allowing us to sit on the open-air
upper deck, feeling the sea breeze on our faces.</p>
<p>On the bus, we met a tour group mainly composed of elderly people.
One elderly man stood out, sitting in the row ahead of us. Unlike the
others in simple appearence, he wore a straw hat, tropical print shirt
and colourful shorts, with a camera on his hand. He started a
conversation with us, revealing he was from Sichuan, an inland province,
and it was his first time seeing the sea. He had traveled to many other
places before and showed us his travel photos, from the icy northeast to
the tropical rainforests of Yunnan and climbing Changbai Mountain. He
even gave us tips on photography such as shutter button...closeup... He
was cheerful and talkative, who is seemed without any worries, which was
truly interesting.</p>
<p>Weihai felt like a fairytale town, with its blue sea at the end of
the road, fresh city scenery, and the refreshing smell of sea salt in
the air. Surprisingly, it's also the closest coastal city in China to
South Korea, with Korean food available everywhere. The sunset over the
sea, with the warm orange painting on the water and waves, was very
touching. We took many valuable photos at sunset, each reminding me of
that summer and our strong friendship.</p>
<p>The island cats, elderly men in slippers, and children playing with
bubbles—all gave the place a warm, vivid feel, making me forget the
hustle and bustle of Shanghai. Weihai, quiet and unassuming, with its
low cost of living and slow pace, would be an ideal place to retire.</p>
<p>This is my hometown. So, every holiday, I take my camera and travel
from south to north, capturing its incredible scenery, which never fails
to inspire me with new ideas.</p>
<p>When we arrived, we planned an 8 AM ferry ride to an island near
Weihai. Arriving at our hotel around 10 PM, we had a late dinner and
then started discussing on our travel plans, pushing our bedtime to
nearly 1 AM. Consequently, we overslept until 9 AM. I suddenly woke up
and jumped at the time I saw the watch, then I woke my friend, and we
rushed to the ferry terminal without brushing teeth or washing faces but
only to find our ferry had left, making our tickets invalid. Luckily, we
were able to catch the last morning ferry at 10:30, reaching the island
successfully. This taught me to better manage my time for important
events.</p>
<p>On the island, we hiked to a lighthouse. My friend spotted a rocky
area with small grey houses and another beach on the other side. He was
eager to go over there to see what it was, but after looking around, we
couldn't find any path leading there, except for a rough rocky trail
along the edge of the cliff. On one side was the sea with sharp rocks,
and on the other side was an almost vertical cliff wall. I could hardly
imagine what would happen if someone were to fall down. Despite the
uneven, water-seeping rocks and the crashing waves nearby, he was
fearless, and I carefully followed. It felt like it only took about ten
minutes, but for me, it seemed like an hour, and though I was sweating,
we safely reached the golden beach. It was a hidden place, untouched by
tourists and undeveloped by the goverment as well, unlike the
commercialized city center beaches. There were no shops or trash, just
sand, shells, and waves.</p>
<p>In the evening, we visited a popular seafood market, bustling with
stalls and restaurants. The crowded and noisy atmosphere wasn't
appealing to me, but Kevin wanted to try the seafood since he was
convinced by the Internet social media. We picked a large restaurant
that looked impressive from the outside, but the oily tables and
odd-smelling utensils like dishes and chopsticks were disappointing. We
chose a yellow fish and some clams, but the heavily seasoned dishes
lacked freshness. The bill shocked us—650 yuan for two dishes, with the
fish alone costing 500 yuan, making it the most overpriced meal I’ve
ever had.</p>
<p>Later, we walked to the market's end, where the air was filled with
the strong odd smell of rotten seafood and garbage. The area was
littered with waste from the nearby restaurants. We took photos and
reported the issue to the local government service platform. To our
surprise, they responded within half a month, fining the responsible
restaurants 10,000 yuan and ordering them to clean up. They also
arranged regular inspections, sharing photos of the cleaned area with
me. This was my first successful complaint, showing Weihai's commitment
to tourism and environmental protection.</p>
<p>At that moment, I thought of introducing a new law that requires
restaurants to manage their own kitchen waste, with penalties of one
month's revenue for illegal dumping.</p>
<p>Cleaner streets and markets will enhance the tourist experience and
protect local wildlife.The law is likely to be popular among residents,
tourists, and governments. They will appreciate the cleaner environment,
making visits and daily life more pleasant. Some restaurant owners might
initially resist, but acceptance will grow as benefits become
evident.</p>

<p>In my home, the most relaxing place for me is a wooden desk. It's a
simple study desk that I bought about 10 years ago. The desk has a white
surface with a green rubber mat on it. Behind it, there's a glass
bookshelf, but instead of books, it's filled with various models. These
models range from motorcycles and airplanes to robots and different
model scenes, all of which I've made by hand since I was in elementary
school.</p>
<p>On the left wall, there are about a dozen tools hanging, such as
sandpaper, and paint. On the right side, there are piles of books and
reference materials that I often use. I got interested in making models
around the age of 10 because my cousin showed me the models he made, and
I was deeply fascinated. Since then, this desk has become my workspace.
Whenever I feel anxious or sad, I sit by this plain desk and immerse
myself in model making. It helps me calm down and forget all the
negative emotions. In the beginning, I faced many challenges, like
sanding the edges and choosing the right paint, but these challenges
didn't make me give up. Instead, I constantly searched for information
in books and online, watching tutorials to overcome these
difficulties.</p>
<p>In the middle of the shelf, there's a large robot model, a Gundam
model from Japan, about 30cm tall. It was a birthday gift from my father
when I turned 16. I was very surprised because it was a model I had
wanted for a long time. About two years ago, I saw it at a model
exhibition. It had a blue and white color scheme, two pairs of
mechanical wings on its back, and it held two light weapons. The eyes
and chest could even light up green, and I was completely appealed. I
showed a photo to my father and vividly described its appearance and
features, but I didn't ask him to buy it because I knew it was expensive
and he didn't want me to be too absorbed in models, fearing it might
affect my studies. However, on my birthday, he bought it for me, and I
was so touched I almost cried. I spent a week assembling it and sprayed
a protective paint on it, then placed it in the center of the bookshelf,
covered with a glass case to protect it. Every time I see it, I can feel
the happiness and excitement from seven years ago.</p>
<p>Even if I don't have time to make models, I sit here every day,
enjoying them, changing their poses, or repainting parts that have faded
over time. This has become my daily routine. These models have witnessed
my growth and represent the progress of my craftsmanship. Whenever
guests visit, their praise on these models make me feel proud.</p>
<p>When relatives and friends visit, some children show interest in my
models. Of course, I don't let them touch the ones on the shelves since
they are elaborate and could be damaged easily. Instead, I take out
simpler models for them to build. For example, when I was in high
school, my cousin came to visit. He was still in elementary school and
showed great interest in my models. So, I took out a tank model and
showed him the basic steps and how to use the tools. He excitedly
started building, and I guided him along the way, ensuring he didn't get
hurt. After more than an hour, he had built most of the tank, and I let
him take it home to finish. The next day, he sent me a photo of the
completed model on WeChat. He was very happy, and it was clear that he
had a passion for model making and could focus on following the
instructions step by step. I was glad to pass on this love for model
making to him.</p>
<p>This desk is also my favorite place to study. Before going to
university, I didn't stay at a boarding school, so every day after
school, I would sit at this desk to rest and do my homework. This desk
has been with me for 11 years of my academic journey, and you can still
see some pen marks on the surface. Although it looks ordinary, it
surpasses any modern desk in the library. Sitting at this desk always
brings a sense of calm, allowing me to focus better on my studies.</p>
<p>One of the websites I frequently use is Bilibili, which is similar to
YouTube and very popular among young people in China, especially
animation fans. A middle school classmate recommended it to me. While
TikTok is known for short videos, Bilibili mainly features traditional
long videos on various topics, from science and fashion to almost all
subjects from elementary to university level. Each video has bullet
comments, where viewers' comments appear on the screen, creating a
shared viewing experience. So, when exams are approaching, I watch
relevant courses on this site for revision. The bullet comments also
help solve difficult points. When I'm bored, I watch interesting or
educational videos to relax and share my favorite videos with
friends.</p>
<p>However, I occasionally come across annoying ads online, especially
on some video or gaming websites. When I play online games or watch
videos, pop-up ads often appear in the lower right corner, showing
pictures of models or scenes of fighting monsters with titles like "Make
money playing poker" or "Make money playing games." But when you click
on them, you find it's actually online gambling, using exaggerated
amounts and slogans to attract people with weak self-control to invest
their money. They tempt people with small rewards to cheat more money.
It seems like a fair game, but everything can be manipulated by the
server's backend. I don't mind shopping or commercial ads because
companies need profits, but these gambling ads that exploit people's
weaknesses to make dirty money are very unacceptable. Telecom fraud
makes many addicted people lose everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to study cybersecurity in the future, either
domestically or abroad for graduate studies. Under the guidance of
professors, I want to strengthen my theoretical knowledge and enhance
practical applications through internships. However, it's a challenging
field because the internet is vast and complex, with various hacking
techniques constantly emerging. Cross-regional communication methods and
various hiding techniques make tracking criminal IPs more difficult. I
hope to combine artificial intelligence and neural networks to
strengthen network defense and completely stop such behavior.</p>
<h3 id="别人给你做的特殊一餐">别人给你做的特殊一餐</h3>
<p>A special meal I remember was made by my grandmother. It was the
first meal I had after coming home for summer vacation in 2022. For the
past two years, this wouldn't have been very special. But that year,
Shanghai had a major COVID-19 outbreak, and we were in lockdown from
March to June. During those three months, I stayed at school, taking
online classes and eating terrible boxed meals, which made me feel quite
depressed.</p>
<p>So, after the lockdown ended and I returned home, my grandmother
personally cooked for me. She started preparing in the morning, going to
the local supermarket to pick fresh ingredients, ensuring that
everything was of the highest quality. She then spent several hours in
the kitchen, carefully cooking each dish with love and attention to
detail. She made xiaolongbao, red cooked pork, and fried chicken because
she knew these were my favorites. Each dish was incredibly delicious,
making me almost forget the awful boxed meals I had for the past three
months.</p>
<p>I was deeply touched by the effort and care my grandmother put into
making this meal. Each bite was filled with warmth and love, making it
not just a meal but a memorable experience.</p>
<h3 id="难用的科技产品想换掉的东西">难用的科技产品，想换掉的东西</h3>
<p>A piece of technology I find difficult to use is a robot vacuum
cleaner that my dad bought quite a while ago. He got it with the
intention of making household cleaning easier, especially for our busy
family. The idea was that it would save us time and effort, keeping the
floors clean without much care.</p>
<p>However, I've found it challenging to operate. The first issue is the
setup; it required connecting to a smartphone app, which often had
connectivity problems. Even after getting it set up, the robot would
frequently get stuck in corners or under furniture, requiring manual
intervention to get it going again. The scheduling feature also didn't
work as smoothly as expected, often leading to the robot starting at odd
hours or not starting at all.</p>
<p>Because of these issues, I don't use it as often as I thought I
would. Instead, I usually end up sweeping the floors myself, which is
faster and less frustrating. While I appreciate the idea behind the
technology, it feels more like a hassle than a help. This has made me a
bit skeptical about other "smart" home devices, as they might promise
convenience but sometimes end up being more trouble than they're
worth.</p>
<h3 id="重要植物">重要植物</h3>
<p>A tree I find significant is the pine tree. The Pine tree is a tall
and evergreen type with slender trunks and needle-like leaves. They have
an elegant look, with uniquely shaped branches.</p>
<p>I often see pine trees in parks and forests, especially in cooler
climates. Near my hometown, there's a forested area filled with pine
trees that I visit often. Their towering presence and the soft rustling
of their needles create a peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>China's most famous pine tree is the Guest-Greeting Pine on Yellow
Mountain. It grows halfway up the mountain at about 1,600 meters high,
with some even rooted on nearly vertical cliffs. Despite being exposed
to wind and rain, these trees stand firmly and unyielding.</p>
<p>Pine trees are vital for their ecosystems, providing habitat and food
for wildlife. They also hold cultural significance, symbolizing
longevity and persistence, especially in East Asian cultures.</p>
<p>Personally, I find pine trees inspiring for their ability to thrive
in harsh conditions. They remind me of the importance of staying strong
and enduring challenges, no matter how difficult they may be.</p>
<h3 id="历史建筑">历史建筑</h3>
<p>One historical building I visited is the Cologne Cathedral, located
in Cologne, Germany. I had the opportunity to visit this iconic landmark
during a study trip to Germany in my second year of high school, where I
was part of a German language class.</p>
<p>The Cologne Cathedral is an impressive Gothic structure, known for
its towering twin spires that reach towards the sky. The exterior is
decorated with complicated stone carvings and detailed sculptures,
showing the art of the medieval craftsmen and architects. Inside, the
cathedral is just as inspiring, with high ceilings, stunning colourful
glass windows, and a sense of magnificence that leaves a lasting
impression on anyone who visits.</p>
<p>Next to the cathedral, we saw some believers praying devoutly.
Inside, the cathedral was dim, creating a solemn atmosphere that matched
exactly what I had imagined a grand cathedral to be like. Later, my
classmates and I climbed the spiral staircase step by step, reaching the
middle section of the cathedral. From there, we could look out and see
the entire cityscape of Cologne, which was truly breathtaking.</p>
<p>Despite the gand feel inside, what I saw outside included the
sleeping cats, elderly men in slippers, and children playing with
bubbles, which all gave the place a warm, vivid feel, making me forget
the hustle and bustle of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Today, the Cologne Cathedral is still used as a place of religion,
but it also attracts millions of tourists from around the world each
year. It’s a World Heritage Site and an important symbol of Cologne’s
history and culture.</p>
<p>During my visit, I learned a great deal about the cathedral’s
history, including the fact that it took over 600 years to complete. I
also gained an understanding of its significance in both religious and
cultural contexts.</p>
<p>I was deeply moved by the large scale and beauty of the Cologne
Cathedral. Standing in its presence, I felt a sense of respect for the
history it represents and the countless generations of people who
contributed to its creation. The visit left me with a greater
appreciation for Gothic architecture and the enduring treasure of such
historical monuments.</p>
